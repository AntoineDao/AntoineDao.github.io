    <p>Hi! I’m Antoine Dao, an Engineering Manager and Developer with a passion for cloud, software, and data engineering. I have experience working across various industries—from sustainability consultancy in construction  to financial platforms.</p>

Currently based in Edinburgh, Scotland, I’m leading the platform team at NatWest Boxed, where we support developers through a Kubernetes-first platform.

In my career, I’ve embraced technologies like Kubernetes, Terraform, Python, Javascript and Golang to deliver scalable backends, onboard new engineers, and introduce MLOps tooling. Whether it’s building web crawlers, deploying Kubernetes clusters, or mentoring teams, I like getting stuck in the mud building and fixing code.

Outside of work, I’m always exploring new tech, contributing to open-source projects, and pushing the limits of my partner's patience while working on an ever growing homeserver.
