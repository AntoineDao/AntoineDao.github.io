<!-- Hi! I’m Antoine Dao, an Engineering Manager and Developer with a passion for cloud, software, and data engineering. I’ve had the privilege of working across various industries—from environmental simulations to financial platforms—while fostering strong team collaboration and solving complex problems together.

Currently based in Edinburgh, Scotland, I’m leading the platform team at NatWest Boxed, where we support developers through a Kubernetes-first platform. I thrive in managing cloud infrastructures on AWS and GCP, optimising cloud spend, and ensuring seamless operational performance through strategic planning and hands-on engineering.

In my career, I’ve embraced technologies like Kubernetes, Terraform, Python, Javascript and Golang to deliver scalable backends, onboard new engineers, and introduce MLOps tooling. Whether it’s building web crawlers, deploying Kubernetes clusters, or mentoring teams, I enjoy the challenge of finding elegant solutions to complex problems.

Outside of work, I’m always exploring new tech, contributing to open-source projects, and pushing the limits of my partner's patience while working on an ever growing homeserver.
